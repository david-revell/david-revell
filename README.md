Hi — I’m David. I build practical AI agents and tool-integrated workflows using the OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, and Phoenix tracing.

My work focuses on applied AI engineering: agentic reasoning, real tool calls, and clean, observable system behaviour.

You can explore my active projects in the pinned repositories below.
